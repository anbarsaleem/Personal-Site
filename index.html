                        <br>
                        I am currently a 12th grader at JFK Memorial HS with an appreciation and proficiency for <b>STEM</b> as seen with my involvement in my school's <b>FIRST Robotics Competition</b> Team, <b>Science Olympiad</b> Team, <b>Central Jersey Math League</b> Team, and <b>Computer Science</b> Club. Besides those extracurriculars, I also pursue different personal projects located on my <a href = "github.com/anbarsaleem">Github</a> profile, including this here website :) . The purpose of these endeavors is to help further my programming arsenal as well as being ways for me to spend my time in both a fun and productive manner.
